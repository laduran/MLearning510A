Create a new text cell in your Notebook: Complete a 50-100 word summary (or short description of your thinking in applying this week's learning to the solution) of your experience in this assignment. Include: What was your incoming experience with this model, if any? what steps you took, what obstacles you encountered. how you link this exercise to real-world, machine learning problem-solving. (What steps were missing? What else do you need to learn?) This summary allows your instructor to know how you are doing and allot points for your effort in thinking and planning, and making connections to real-world work."
